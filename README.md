## üê≥ Running the Portfolio with Docker

### 1. Build the Docker Image

docker build -t abao_marissa_coding_assignment14 .

### 2. Run the container

docker run -p 5575:80 abao_marissa_coding_assignment14

### 3. View in your browser

Open: http://localhost:5575

### NOTE: Use these commands to rebuild the portfolio‚Äôs Docker image from scratch and run it locally. Helpful if you see old content or 404s on refresh.

### Create a fresh Docker image from the current folder and name it `abao_marissa_coding_assignment14`. `--no-cache` avoids reusing old layers so your latest changes are included.
docker build --no-cache -t abao_marissa_coding_assignment14 .

### Start a container from that image, auto-remove it when you stop, and map your computer‚Äôs port 5575 to the container‚Äôs port 80 so the site is at `http://localhost:5575`.
docker run --rm -p 5575:80 abao_marissa_coding_assignment14
